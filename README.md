There are six kinds of folders: interview transcript, paper, proposal, research data, research paper and work flow.

I category the different files in to different folders and rename the same type files in to a consist format, for example, rename the picture from "pic.png" and "image.png" to "pic1" and "pic2" which are in the order of number.

Guideline: category the type of files and place them in to their belonging flolders, if there is not a folder match their types, create a new one folder!
